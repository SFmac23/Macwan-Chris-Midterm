- Responsive design adapting to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.  
- Sticky header with logo, navigation links, and “Buy Now” call-to-action button.  
- Hamburger menu for mobile navigation toggling.  
- Hero section with animated text and images.  
- Best selling products showcase with hover effects.  
- Our Story section with images and descriptive paragraphs side-by-side.  
- Smooth fade-in animations to enhance user experience.  
- Clean code following best practices for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Coding Standards and Notes  
- Used `const` and `let` in JavaScript exclusively; no `var`.  
- No `DOMContentLoaded` event used; script placed at end of body for proper loading.  
- `querySelector` used instead of `getElementById`.  
- All event handlers are named functions for clarity and reusability.  
- Minimal and personalized comments explaining decisions and logic.  
- Semantic HTML with proper heading structure for accessibility.  

## Future Improvements  
- Add real “Buy Now” functionality linked to an e-commerce platform.  
- Implement a contact form with validation.  
- Enhance animations with JavaScript for richer interactions.  
- Optimize images for faster loading.
